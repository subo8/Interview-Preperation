#### React
````
~ React is library created and maintained by Facebook that is used for building 
  user interfaces.
~ The only difference between React and Angular is that react at its core 
  is only responsible for creating. 
~ It doesn't have things like a router or an HTTP client built in. 
~ However, we have popular packages like React Router Dom 
  then we have the fetch API that's already built into the browser
